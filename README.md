# InstantiateObject
Just a simple script to instantiate obejcts through a button on Unity - GameObject based on a prefab!

It's really simple to use it. Just follow the steps:

1. Add the script (InstantiateObjects -> Program.cs) on this repositorie to some button or any kinda of "On Click" action you want;
2. Acess the GameObject you put the script as a component;
3. On the component, drag the prefab you want to instantiate;
4. That's it!

P.S: I highly reccomend you to put some "destroy button" to your prefab, so you can click this button and delete that prefab.
