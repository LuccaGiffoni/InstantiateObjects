# InstantiateObject
Just a simple script to instantiate obejcts through a button on Unity - GameObject based on a prefab!

It's really simple to use it. You just need to add this script to some button or any kinda of "On Click" action you want.
Then, just acess the script - as a component on your button - and add the prefab you want to instantiate as you click the buttton.
